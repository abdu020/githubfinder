# githubfinder
Building a Github finder app where you can search users by username and it will show you their profile and other information such as their 5 latest repositories. The interface is built using Bootswatch which is a bootstrap theme. I use Async and Await and Fetch API to get the user information from Github. I make two request to the Github API. First I get the profile information and next I want to get their latest repos with links to them.
